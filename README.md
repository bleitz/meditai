A simple application that autogenerates personalized, guided meditations and self-support sessions.

The script is genererated by the OpenAI API.
The audio is generated by Azure's Text-to-Speech API.


## Background

Meditation can help when approaching challenging topics. I often struggle to self reflect, explore difficult ideas or fight stubborn patterns of thought: My mind is quick to get distracted or to interrupt itself with opposing opinions. I have found that guided meditation can help me here: It allows me to drop inherent resistance, be more receiptive to change and make it easier for me to resist distractions. 

Meditation apps focus on core meditation techniques (e.g. around mindfulness or gratitude meditations). Sometimes, they even offer sessions on specifc thoughts, feelings, topics or ideas. But, naturally, these are very general and cannot be specific to the meditators personal concerns or address specific themes that they wish to address.

AI can help. ChatGPT is able to generate decent meditation scripts: they are gentle, visual and incorporate specific prompts quite well. And Text-to-Speech technology makes the scripts come to life: Azure's TTS API provides a very convincing quality of speech with pleasant tones of voice e.g. "whispering". 

Background music, an appropriate rate of speech and fitting pauses all help to create a warm experience.
