A simple application that autogenerates personalized, guided meditations and self-support sessions.

The script is genererated by the OpenAI API.
The audio is generated by Azure's Text-to-Speech API.


## Background

I often struggle to self reflect, explore difficult ideas or fight stubborn patterns of thought: My mind is quick to get distracted or to interrupt itself with opposing opinions. I have found that guided meditation can help me here: It allows me to drop inherent resistance, be more receiptive to change and make it easier for me to resist distractions.

Meditation apps are great! But either they focus on core meditation techniques (e.g. around mindfulness or gratitude meditations) or they address very general themes. Naturally, they cannot be specific to the meditators personal thoughts nor should they.

And here AI can lend us a hand: ChatGPT is able to generate surprisingly gentle, visual and specific scripts. And todays Text-to-Speech technology makes the scripts come to life.Azure's TTS API provides a very convincing quality of speech with pleasant tones of voice e.g. "whispering". 

Background music, an appropriate rate of speech and fitting pauses all help to create a warm experience.
