A simple application that autogenerates personalized guided meditations.

The script is genererated by the OpenAI API given my meditation prompt.
The audio is generated by Azure's Text-to-Speech API.


## Background

Meditation help to address challenging topic. I often struggle to contemplate difficult ideas or stubborn patterns of thought: My mind is quick to get distracted or to interrupt itself with opposing opinions. I have found that guided meditations can help me here: They allow me to drop inherent resistance and make it easier for me to resist distractions. 

Existing meditation apps provide very general support. Aside from e.g. mindfulness or gratitude meditations, usual meditation apps sometimes offer sessions that focus on specifc thoughts, feelings topics and ideas. But naturally these very general and cannot be specific to my personal concerns or very specific themes that I wish to address.

Generative AI, however, can. ChatGPT is able to generate decent meditation scripts: they are gentle, visual and incorporate specific prompts quite well. 

Text-to-speech technology makes the scripts come to life: Azure's TTS API provides a very convincing quality of speech with pleasant tones of voice e.g. "whispering". 

Background sounds, appropriate rate of speech and pauses round off the meditation experience.
